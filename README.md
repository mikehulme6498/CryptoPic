Program to hide messages into images and decode them

As a crypto enthusiast I didn't like the idea of having my wallet seeds all stored on my computer / cloud or even just on paper.
So I wrote this program to hide my seeds into images.

#### Video Demo

Key Features

Add random words to increase difficulty of decoding (adds two words for every word in your message).
Use your own 7 digit keyword as an encryption key (prevents someone with the same program decoding your image).
Your message including the extra words are all encrpyted before embedding in image.
Charactors in image are not embedded in order. So if someone does work out there is something in the image, it is almost impossible to decode.

Please feel free to add pull requests with anything you thing should be added / changed.

***** Please note my own personal offline version has a different embedding pattern so you wont get my crypto wallet seeds :) ********
